Phase: ETHICAL_ANALYSIS
----------------------------------------------------------------------
During the ethical analysis phase, participants engaged in a robust
debate on the Trolley Problem, exploring the utilitarian perspective
focused on consequential outcomes versus deontological principles that
emphasize moral duties and integrity. Key arguments highlighted the
tension between maximizing happiness at the potential cost of
individual rights and the importance of maintaining moral integrity,
leading to a deeper understanding of the ethical implications
underlying each framework. The conversation set the stage for future
discussions by identifying the complexities in balancing outcomes and
moral obligations.
