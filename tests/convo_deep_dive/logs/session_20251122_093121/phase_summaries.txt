In this phase of the meeting focused on ethical analysis of the
Trolley Problem, participants engaged in a robust discussion exploring
the implications of utilitarianism versus deontological ethics. The
conversation emphasized the value of understanding different ethical
frameworks to illuminate the complexities of moral decision-making,
particularly the tension between outcomes and individual rights. No
definitive positions or decisions were made, as the dialogue served to
reinforce participants' beliefs about the necessity of incorporating
multiple ethical perspectives in moral debates.

Phase: ETHICAL_INTEGRATION

In this meeting phase, participants explored the utilitarian
perspective on the Trolley Problem, emphasizing the importance of
maximizing overall happiness and minimizing suffering through a
numerical assessment of outcomes. While no specific positions or key
arguments were finalized, the discussion highlighted the utilitarian
moral responsibility in challenging ethical dilemmas. The group made
progress in understanding how this perspective interacts with
deontological views, setting the stage for further exploration of
common ground.
