Phase: ETHICAL_ANALYSIS
----------------------------------------------------------------------
In this meeting phase, participants engaged in a rigorous
philosophical debate on the Trolley Problem, analyzing it through
utilitarian and deontological lenses. The utilitarian perspective
emphasized the importance of maximizing overall happiness and
considered the emotional impact of decisions, while the deontological
approach underscored the inviolability of individual rights and the
moral implications of sacrificing one life for the greater good.
Ultimately, the discussion highlighted the tension between these
ethical frameworks, particularly regarding the potential justification
of harm and the inherent value of individuals.
