======================================================================

Phase: ETHICAL_ANALYSIS
----------------------------------------------------------------------
In this meeting phase, participants conducted an in-depth analysis of
the Trolley Problem through the lenses of utilitarianism and
deontological ethics. While the Utilitarian Ethicist emphasized the
importance of maximizing overall well-being, the Deontological
Philosophers consistently reaffirmed their commitment to moral
principles that prioritize individual rights over outcomes. No
consensus was reached, as disagreements regarding the evaluation of
moral actions based on consequences versus principles remained
prominent.

Phase: ETHICAL_INTEGRATION
----------------------------------------------------------------------
In this meeting phase, participants explored the Trolley Problem from
both utilitarian and deontological perspectives, with an emphasis on
finding common ground. The discussion highlighted the importance of
weighing consequences alongside emotional and psychological factors in
moral decision-making, as well as the role of character development in
understanding ethical behavior. No specific positions or arguments
were solidified, but the foundation for future discussions was
established by recognizing the interplay between various ethical
considerations.
