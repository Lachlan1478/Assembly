PHASE SUMMARIES
======================================================================

Phase: ETHICAL_ANALYSIS
----------------------------------------------------------------------
In this phase of the meeting, participants engaged in a thorough
analysis of the Trolley Problem through the lenses of utilitarianism
and deontology. While both ethical theorists maintained their
positions and agreed on the importance of examining individual rights
versus collective happiness, no consensus was reached on specific
scenarios where individual rights could be overridden within the
utilitarian framework, leaving room for further exploration in future
discussions. The necessity of understanding moral duties and the
implications of conflicting ethical principles was highlighted as a
pivotal aspect of this debate.

Phase: ETHICAL_INTEGRATION
----------------------------------------------------------------------
In this phase, participants found common ground between utilitarian
and deontological perspectives on the Trolley Problem by emphasizing
the moral weight of individual rights. A key decision was the
establishment of a conditional rule stating that outcomes must always
respect individual rights, particularly in high-stakes dilemmas, which
shifted belief states among participants and fostered a deeper
commitment to rights preservation. The discussion highlighted a mutual
recognition that moral considerations should balance both individual
rights and broader outcomes.
