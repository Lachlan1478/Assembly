ADD: Let's explore the boundary case of a scenario where the individuals on the tracks are not innocent bystanders, but rather, active perpetrators of harm. This complicates our moral duty, challenging us to consider the implications of culpability and ethical obligations toward those we may feel justified in sacrificing."
