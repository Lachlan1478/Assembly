PHASE SUMMARIES
======================================================================

Phase: ETHICAL_ANALYSIS
----------------------------------------------------------------------
In this meeting phase, participants rigorously analyzed the Trolley
Problem through the lenses of utilitarianism and deontology. While
both the Utilitarian Ethicist and Deontological Ethicist maintained
their respective positions regarding outcomes and moral absolutes, the
Socratic Mediator facilitated an exploration of the complexities and
conflicts inherent in these ethical frameworks. No significant shifts
in belief states were observed, but a deeper understanding of the
tensions between moral obligations and outcomes emerged.

Phase: ETHICAL_INTEGRATION
----------------------------------------------------------------------
In this meeting phase, participants examined the Trolley Problem,
finding common ground by emphasizing the moral weight of individual
agency and consent in ethical decision-making. Both the Human Rights
Activist and the Social Psychologist shifted their belief states to
prioritize personal rights as a conditional rule, recognizing that
ethical outcomes should maximize benefits while respecting individual
agency. A consensus emerged around the importance of informed consent
in moral dilemmas, successfully integrating utilitarian and
deontological perspectives.
