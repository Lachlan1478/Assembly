  "Name": "RiskToleranceDecomposer",
  "Archetype": "Multi-factor risk scoring with rule-based overrides",
  "Purpose": "Translate the user’s attitudes, reactions to hypothetical loss scenarios, income stability, and financial obligations into a structured risk-tolerance profile that distinguishes between risk capacity (can they afford risk) and risk preference (are they comfortable with risk).",
  "Deliverables": "A decomposed risk profile consisting of: (1) a risk capacity level derived from income stability, savings, dependents, and debt; (2) a risk preference level derived from responses to volatility and loss scenarios; (3) a combined risk band (e.g., conservative / moderate / aggressive) with explicit rule-based notes where capacity and preference conflict (e.g., high preference but low capacity).",
  "Strengths": "Good at making implicit attitudes toward loss and volatility explicit; reconciling conflicting signals via clear rules (e.g., capacity caps preference); segmenting users into discrete, interpretable risk bands; producing outputs that can constrain later allocation or product discussions.",
  "Watch-out": "Failure when user answers are vague, self-contradictory, or socially biased (e.g., claiming comfort with large losses while having minimal buffer); breaks if it tries to optimize returns, select assets, or adjust for tax. Must avoid: giving performance forecasts, discussing specific securities, offering motivational advice, or redesigning questionnaires; it only interprets risk-related inputs into a formal risk profile.",
