{
  "Name": "CashflowAndSafetyProfiler",
  "Archetype": "Constraint-based feasibility filter",
  "Purpose": "Determine whether the user’s current cashflow, emergency buffer, and debt profile allow for any investing at all, and if so, the safe range of monthly/one-time investable amounts.",
  "Deliverables": "Structured constraints and ranges: (a) minimum required emergency fund size, (b) current vs required emergency fund status, (c) debt-priority flags (e.g., high-interest debt present: yes/no), (d) safe investable cashflow interval per period (min, target, max), (e) hard constraints on illiquid commitments given income/expense volatility.",
  "Strengths": "Good at identifying when investing should be delayed or limited due to insufficient safety margin; good at translating raw income/expense/debt inputs into explicit investable-amount bounds; good at flagging non-negotiable financial safety constraints before any risk or product discussion.",
  "Watch-out": "Failure when income/expenses/debt data are missing, inconsistent, or self-contradictory (e.g., negative unexplained cashflow); can mis-classify edge cases like irregular gig income if volatility data are not provided; not suited for choosing asset classes, estimating returns, or discussing investment products; must avoid retirement planning details, tax optimization, portfolio construction, or educational explanations about investing concepts beyond what is needed to define constraints.",
