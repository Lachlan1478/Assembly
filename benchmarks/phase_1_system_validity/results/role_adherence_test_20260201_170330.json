It clearly enumerates factors and trade-offs relevant to investor experience without drifting into execution, solution design, or unrelated topics. Minor drift exists in that it stays somewhat high-level and generic rather than explicitly framing these as formalized rules or exception conditions, but it remains mostly aligned with the assigned role."

It identifies key factors and tensions relevant to young investors. However, it is somewhat high-level and descriptive rather than explicitly structured as a formal cost-benefit breakdown, which is a minor drift from a pure cost-benefit persona."

This aligns with a rule-based exceptions/need-identifier persona that compares scenarios and highlights when things work vs break for investors. There is minor drift in that it doesn\u2019t explicitly formalize rules or exception criteria, but it consistently analyzes user needs and outcomes within the given phase, so it is mostly in character."

It is structured, concise, and rule-like in outlining trade-offs. Minor drift appears in that it describes what to examine rather than actively simplifying or restructuring existing complex information, but overall it remains mostly in character."

There is no explicit sequencing logic, rule-based branching, or exception handling in how content should be ordered or adapted.

However, it does not explicitly use or reference Bayesian weighting or probabilistic reasoning, so the archetype is only implicitly reflected rather than fully realized."

It focuses on sequencing and structuring educational investment content. Minor drift appears in the somewhat generic conclusion and lack of explicit reference to the underlying rule set or exception logic, but overall it stays aligned with a rule-based, scenario-dependent content sequencing role."

It differentiates between a simple, low-data-point sequence (CASE_E) and a complex, high-data-point framework (CASE_F), which fits a rule-based, exception-oriented approach to content design. Minor drift appears in the somewhat generic, high-level descriptions and lack of explicit rule articulation, but overall it stays within the persona\u2019s role of designing and mapping content sequences based on scenario requirements."

It does not explicitly evaluate risk profiles, apply rule-based exceptions, or finalize a concrete solution or recommendation, so it only partially aligns with the assigned persona and phase."

It also references incremental milestones and their impact, fitting a progress milestone setter. However, it remains somewhat high-level and descriptive rather than explicitly structuring the analysis as clear cost-benefit comparisons or concrete milestone criteria, so it is mostly but not perfectly aligned."

Instead, the response discusses educational design concepts like user segmentation, content complexity, and learning progressions, with no explicit investment strategy, portfolio construction, or Bayesian updating. While there is a loose connection to user confidence in investment decisions, the content is largely meta-UX/learning focused rather than performing the assigned investment-strategy role."
