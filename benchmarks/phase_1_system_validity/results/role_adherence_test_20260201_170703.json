      "reasoning": "The response focuses on systematically identifying user needs, constraints, and trade-offs in the investment experience, which aligns with a Need Identifier in a rule-based, analytical mode. It highlights key factors (clarity, guidance, education) and central tensions (information depth vs. overload, guidance vs. autonomy), fitting the understanding_investor_needs phase. There is minor drift in that it remains somewhat high-level and generic rather than explicitly framed as rule-based exceptions, but it is still mostly in character."

It identifies relevant dimensions (education vs overload, guidance vs independence, immediacy vs long-term growth) in a structured way. However, it stops short of explicitly framing these as concrete cost-benefit evaluations or quantifying impacts, so it is mostly but not perfectly aligned with a cost-benefit analysis persona."

It describes effects (confidence, frustration, engagement) rather than explicitly identifying or applying structured rules or exception conditions about investor needs. Some alignment exists in that it references user needs (clarity, education, confidence), but it lacks the rule-based, conditional framing expected of a 'Rule-based exceptions' Need Identifier."

This aligns with a rule-based, exception-style comparison and is appropriate for the understanding_investor_needs phase.

There is no explicit concern assessment, no probabilistic or weighted framing, and no clear articulation of likelihoods or relative risk/impact of different concerns.

The mention of cost efficiency truncation is slightly meta and not directly about simplifying information for the user, causing minor drift but not enough to break the role."

There is no explicit use of rules, exception handling, or structured sequencing logic; instead, it stays at a conceptual, high-level description of tensions in content design. This makes it partially aligned with educational content design but not clearly in the specific persona role of rule-based, exception-driven sequencing."

It discusses key factors to examine and explicit trade-offs, fitting the Content Personalizer role. Minor drift exists in that it remains somewhat high-level and could more explicitly frame points as costs and benefits, but overall it stays within the assigned archetype."

However, it does not explicitly reference probabilistic or Bayesian updating concepts, so the Bayesian aspect is implicit rather than clearly articulated, leading to a slight deduction from a perfect score."

It applies rule-based distinctions between CASE_C and CASE_D (e.g., ~10 vs. 75 data points, basic vs. advanced), consistent with a rule-based exceptions archetype. Minor drift appears in somewhat generic phrasing about investment topics rather than explicitly formalizing or referencing exception rules, but the core behavior remains within the assigned role."

      "reasoning": "The response largely behaves as a Content Sequencer in an educational_content_design phase: it structures content into modules, differentiates between a simple (CASE_E) and complex (CASE_F) scenario, and references data-point counts and interactive elements, which aligns with rule-based exception handling between user levels. The minor drift is that the description is somewhat high-level and narrative rather than explicitly framed as rule-based exception logic (e.g., no explicit conditional rules or exception patterns are spelled out), but overall it stays mostly within the intended persona and task."

However, it does not explicitly evaluate or categorize risk profiles, apply rule-based exceptions, or finalize a concrete solution or recommendation. It stays at a meta-UX/education level rather than performing rule-based risk evaluation, so it is partially aligned but not clearly acting as a rule-based risk profile evaluator in a solution-finalization phase."

However, it is somewhat abstract and does not explicitly frame points as concrete costs and benefits or tie them directly to milestone-setting structure, so there is minor drift from the persona\u2019s more specific focus on progress milestones."

It does not discuss portfolios, asset allocation, probabilistic updating, or investment decision-making, so it is mostly out of character for an Investment Strategy Recommender with a Bayesian weighting archetype."

The content is mostly generic UX/learning design analysis rather than rule-based risk profiling or exception handling, with only very indirect relevance to risk evaluation."

The response instead analyzes educational content design, user segmentation by proficiency, and engagement/learning progression, without mentioning investment strategies, asset allocation, or Bayesian weighting. While it touches on user sophistication (beginner vs advanced), it does so in a pedagogical rather than investment-recommendation context, making it mostly out of character."
