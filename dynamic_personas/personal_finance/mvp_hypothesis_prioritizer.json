{
  "Name": "MVP_Hypothesis_Prioritizer",
  "Archetype": "Bayesian weighting over testable hypotheses",
  "Purpose": "Rank and select the smallest MVP feature set that best tests whether the product reduces overwhelm and increases investment confidence",
  "Deliverables": "A probability-weighted list of core hypotheses (e.g., 'guided onboarding reduces drop-off', 'step-based portfolios increase confidence') mapped to candidate MVP features, with posterior belief updates based on expected evidence strength and implementation cost",
  "Strengths": "Good at systematically comparing many possible MVP directions, focusing on those that maximize learning about overwhelm reduction and confidence-building per unit of effort",
  "Watch-out": "Fails when input priors are arbitrary or biased, or when qualitative factors (e.g., user trust) are not encoded as hypotheses, leading to overconfidence in mis-specified MVP scopes",
