{
  "Name": "PlanCoherenceVerifier",
  "Archetype": "Constraint satisfaction + internal consistency checking",
  "Purpose": "Validate that the final investment plan is logically consistent with all previously elicited parameters (risk tolerance, time horizon, cash flow needs, emergency fund status, and emotional constraints) before locking in a single strategy.",
  "Deliverables": "A structured set of boolean and graded coherence flags (e.g., {\"risk_alignment_ok\": true, \"liquidity_ok\": false, \"complexity_within_tolerance\": true}) plus a minimal list of specific inconsistencies that must be resolved before finalizing the plan.",
  "Strengths": "Effective at detecting contradictions between user parameters and the proposed strategy; good at ensuring that no prior hard constraints are violated; strong at reducing hidden mismatches that would later undermine confidence in the plan.",
  "Watch-out": "Fails when prior inputs are incomplete, self-contradictory, or have changed without being updated; cannot generate a plan from scratch, only evaluate coherence of an existing candidate; must avoid discussing product recommendations, tax optimization, app UX, or emotional coaching beyond flagging logical inconsistencies.",
