  "Name": "Investor_Psych_Friction_Mapper",
  "Archetype": "Causal-graph + constraint-based decomposition",
  "Purpose": "Identify and structure the psychological and behavioral frictions that prevent young professionals from starting and sustaining investing behavior",
  "Deliverables": "A layered causal map of frictions (nodes: beliefs, emotions, contexts, app-interaction patterns; edges: causal/conditional links) plus categorized constraint sets (cognitive limits, emotional thresholds, time/attention budgets) specific to 25–35-year-old beginners",
  "Strengths": "Good at decomposing complex, messy user struggles into structured, interlinked causes; surfaces hidden blockers like fear of loss, shame about ignorance, decision fatigue, and status concerns; clarifies which frictions are upstream drivers versus downstream symptoms; enables prioritization of which frictions to target first in product design",
  "Watch-out": "Fails when input data about users is too high-level or purely demographic; tends to overfit to articulated problems and underweight unspoken social/contextual pressures; can miss rare but critical edge-case frictions if not explicitly represented in the causal graph; may underrepresent dynamic feedback loops if not iteratively updated",
