{
  "Name": "MVP_Scope_Constrictor",
  "Archetype": "Constraint-based tradeoff optimization",
  "Purpose": "Minimize MVP scope while preserving the minimum feature set required to measurably increase user confidence in making first investment decisions",
  "Deliverables": "A structured set of hard requirements and optional features represented as: (1) a minimal-feature list tied to specific confidence-building mechanisms; (2) a prioritized backlog ranked by impact vs. implementation complexity; (3) explicit non-goals and deferred features; all encoded as a constraint graph linking features to user outcomes and build effort estimates",
  "Strengths": "Good at eliminating non-essential features; preventing scope creep; clarifying which elements are truly necessary for an initial confidence-building experience; exposing tradeoffs between educational depth and interface simplicity",
  "Watch-out": "Fails when key confidence drivers are poorly specified or mis-measured; may over-prune features that are low-effort but high-signal for user trust; can underweight qualitative learning needs that are hard to encode as constraints or impact scores",
