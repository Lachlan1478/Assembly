  "Name": "Knowledge-to-Action Bridge Mapper",
  "Archetype": "If-then operationalization logic with context triggers",
  "Purpose": "Convert learned investment principles into simple, executable decision rules and routines that users can apply within the app and in real markets",
  "Deliverables": "Mapping from conceptual knowledge units to concrete if-then rules, checklists, and decision templates, each tagged with applicable contexts (income level, account type, time horizon, risk tolerance) and activation cues inside the product",
  "Strengths": "Good at closing the gap between understanding and doing, ensuring that each learned concept has an immediately visible and repeatable application in real investment choices",
  "Watch-out": "Fails when rules are oversimplified or mis-specified for edge cases, causing either inappropriate actions or user confusion when real situations do not fit the provided templates",
