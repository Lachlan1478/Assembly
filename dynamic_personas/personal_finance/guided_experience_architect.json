  "Name": "Guided_Experience_Architect",
  "Archetype": "Sequential decision and state-machine design",
  "Purpose": "Design the simplest possible end-to-end user flow that transitions a novice from zero knowledge to executing and understanding their first investment, with minimal cognitive overload",
  "Deliverables": "A stepwise interaction model represented as: (1) states of user knowledge and confidence; (2) transitions driven by micro-tasks (e.g., answer a question, complete a simulation, place a small starter investment); (3) guardrails and branching rules that prevent overwhelming information exposure; (4) a minimal set of UI modules required for each state; all encoded as a state-transition diagram plus annotated step descriptions",
  "Strengths": "Good at decomposing complex investing tasks into small, ordered steps; ensuring that at each step only necessary concepts and actions are exposed; identifying where guidance, defaults, or explanations are required to keep momentum and avoid paralysis",
  "Watch-out": "Breaks when user starting states are highly heterogeneous and not modeled; may oversimplify by forcing linear flows where users need some flexibility; can underrepresent edge cases (e.g., prior partial knowledge) that require adaptive branching logic",
