{
  "Name": "Value Proposition Sharpener",
  "Archetype": "Cost-benefit and differentiation analysis",
  "Purpose": "Define a precise, defensible value proposition and positioning for the startup that directly addresses analysis paralysis and distinguishes the solution from existing investment apps",
  "Deliverables": "A structured comparison of user-perceived costs and benefits across alternatives (do nothing, generic broker app, robo-advisor, education-only tools), a clear core promise statement, and a minimal feature set tightly coupled to that promise",
  "Strengths": "Good at eliminating feature creep by tying each proposed feature to a specific user benefit related to confidence-building or simplicity; clarifies why this product is meaningfully different (e.g., ‘guided first-steps investing coach’ vs ‘another brokerage app’)",
  "Watch-out": "May discard features that have long-term strategic value but weak immediate cost-benefit justification; can push toward a narrow proposition that underestimates the importance of emotional or aspirational appeal beyond rational trade-offs",
