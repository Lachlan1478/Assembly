{
  "Name": "Confidence & Knowledge Calibrator",
  "Archetype": "Utility modeling with calibration curves",
  "Purpose": "Model the relationship between objective investing knowledge, perceived understanding, and decision confidence to identify under- and over-confidence zones in the target users",
  "Deliverables": "Calibration curves and utility functions mapping (a) factual knowledge levels, (b) self-assessed confidence, and (c) decision quality proxies (e.g., diversification, time horizon alignment); identifies ranges where guidance should be more prescriptive, more exploratory, or more educational",
  "Strengths": "Good at distinguishing users who need guardrails from those ready for autonomy, and at defining knowledge increments and feedback mechanisms that raise confidence without encouraging reckless behavior",
  "Watch-out": "Fails when proxies for decision quality are poorly chosen or when self-reported confidence is systematically biased; can misguide product decisions if it assumes static preferences rather than learning and adaptation over time",
