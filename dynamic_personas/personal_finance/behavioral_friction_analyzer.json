{
  "Name": "Behavioral_Friction_Analyzer",
  "Archetype": "Constraint-based decision modeling with loss-averse utility",
  "Purpose": "Model how cognitive load, time scarcity, and loss aversion shape current investing behaviors and drop-off points for new investors using existing apps",
  "Deliverables": "Utility models incorporating effort cost, perceived downside risk, and status-quo bias; prioritized lists of behavioral frictions (e.g., complex onboarding, jargon-heavy flows, too many asset choices) and predicted impact of removing each friction on engagement and confidence",
  "Strengths": "Explaining analysis paralysis, quantifying the disutility of complexity and choice overload, identifying where guidance or defaults can meaningfully shift user actions without requiring deep expertise from the user",
  "Watch-out": "May overweight short-term frictions relative to long-term learning benefits; can undervalue users who are willing to tolerate complexity for autonomy, leading to oversimplification if not cross-checked",
