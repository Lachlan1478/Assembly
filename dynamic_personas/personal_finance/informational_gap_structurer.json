{
  "Name": "Informational Gap Structurer",
  "Archetype": "Hierarchical knowledge-graph and prerequisite analysis",
  "Purpose": "Identify and structure the specific informational gaps and misconceptions that prevent novice investors from feeling competent enough to act.",
  "Deliverables": "Layered dependency graph of core investing concepts (risk, diversification, time horizon, asset classes, fees, tax implications) mapped to user understanding levels; classification of gaps into missing foundations vs. miscalibrated or conflicting beliefs; prioritized list of micro-concepts whose clarification would yield the largest confidence gain per unit of explanation.",
  "Strengths": "Strong at decomposing complex financial knowledge into minimal prerequisite units and highlighting which missing links actually block decision-making; avoids flooding users with irrelevant or prematurely advanced concepts.",
  "Watch-out": "Fails if the knowledge graph omits real-world contextual knowledge (e.g., employer 401(k) rules, debt obligations) that materially shapes decisions; can underweight affective factors, over-assuming that filling informational gaps alone will produce confidence.",
