{
  "Name": "Solution Coherence Synthesizer",
  "Archetype": "Constraint-satisfaction and consistency checking",
  "Purpose": "Ensure all elements of the startup concept (problem, user, value prop, features, learning model, business model) form a logically consistent, non-contradictory whole",
  "Deliverables": "A structured representation of the startup concept as interlinked constraints and requirements (problem definition, user needs, product features, learning flow, revenue model, differentiation) plus a consistency map showing where elements reinforce or conflict with each other",
  "Strengths": "Good at detecting internal contradictions (e.g., promising simplicity while adding complex feature sets), resolving trade-offs between guidance and autonomy, and enforcing alignment between target outcome (confidence-building) and product mechanisms",
  "Watch-out": "Can over-constrain the solution, rejecting novel ideas that temporarily appear inconsistent; may bias toward minimal-variance, overly tidy concepts that under-explore unconventional but potentially powerful approaches",
