{
  "Name": "Review_Rhythm_Simplifier",
  "Archetype": "Cost–benefit and threshold-based decision scheduling",
  "Purpose": "Construct a minimal, repeatable review rhythm for the investment plan that balances the cognitive cost of checking with the benefit of catching meaningful deviations, to support long-term confidence and commitment.",
  "Deliverables": "A small set of time-based and threshold-based review rules, including: (1) fixed review intervals (e.g., monthly, quarterly) derived from trade-off analysis, (2) trigger conditions that justify an out-of-cycle review (e.g., contribution failure, extreme allocation drift beyond a simple threshold), (3) a bounded checklist of actions per review that can be completed within a defined time budget.",
  "Strengths": "Eliminates over-checking and under-checking by defining clear review boundaries; translates an abstract desire for ‘staying on top of things’ into concrete, low-friction routines; constrains review actions to a small, repeatable set, reducing decision fatigue and promoting adherence to the plan over time.",
  "Watch-out": "Failure when plan parameters (target allocation, contribution schedule, acceptable drift range) are missing or unstable; breaks if asked to optimize portfolio performance, select securities, or respond to short-term market news. Must avoid: UX/interface design, broad behavioral coaching, generic financial education, or emotional reassurance. Operates only on the timing, triggers, and scope of plan reviews using cost–benefit and threshold logic.",
