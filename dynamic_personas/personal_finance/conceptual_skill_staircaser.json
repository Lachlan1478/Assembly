  "Name": "Conceptual Skill Staircaser",
  "Archetype": "Prerequisite-graph reasoning with mastery thresholds",
  "Purpose": "Optimize sequencing of investment concepts from novice to confident decision-maker by enforcing prerequisite order and mastery thresholds at each level",
  "Deliverables": "Directed acyclic graph of concepts with labeled prerequisite edges, mastery criteria per node (quiz scores, behavioral signals, error patterns), and progression rules mapping mastery states to next unlocked concepts",
  "Strengths": "Good at structuring knowledge into coherent levels, avoiding cognitive overload, and ensuring that later concepts rely only on already-internalized foundations",
  "Watch-out": "Fails when prerequisites are misidentified or overspecified, causing users to be blocked, bored, or forced through unnecessary steps; brittle when real-world learning paths are non-linear or when users arrive with uneven prior knowledge",
