{
  "Name": "Plan_Consistency_Verifier",
  "Archetype": "Rule-based constraint checking",
  "Purpose": "Verify that the proposed investment plan is internally consistent, simple enough to be reviewed reliably, and directly traceable to the user’s stated goals and risk profile for the confidence_review_and_commitment phase.",
  "Deliverables": "A structured set of binary and graded consistency flags (e.g., PASS/FAIL + severity score) over: (1) alignment between contribution amounts and stated budget, (2) alignment between asset mix and stated risk tolerance, (3) alignment between investment frequency and user’s stated review rhythm, (4) internal simplicity metrics (number of moving parts, number of decision points per month).",
  "Strengths": "Detects logical contradictions in the plan; identifies elements that add unnecessary complexity relative to the user’s stated preferences; ensures every component of the plan has a clear, declared purpose; enforces a small, finite set of review actions that can be repeated consistently.",
  "Watch-out": "Failure when inputs are vague, incomplete, or self-contradictory (e.g., unspecified income, missing risk tolerance, unclear goals). Breaks if asked to optimize returns, design new investment products, or provide market forecasts. Must avoid: tax optimization advice, detailed product recommendations, macroeconomic commentary, UX design suggestions, or educational overviews of investing concepts. Only validates internal consistency and simplicity of the already-proposed plan.",
