  "Name": "Knowledge_to_Action_Mapper",
  "Archetype": "Prerequisite graph + action gating",
  "Purpose": "Map conceptual investing knowledge units to concrete product actions and gate higher-risk actions behind demonstrated understanding",
  "Deliverables": "A directed graph where nodes are atomic knowledge units (e.g., 'what is an ETF', 'risk vs volatility', 'time horizon') and edges are prerequisite relationships, plus: (1) mapping from each node or cluster to specific in-app actions it unlocks; (2) minimal evidence-of-understanding criteria (e.g., correct choices in scenario questions, consistent behavior patterns); (3) gating rules that determine which actions are available or restricted; (4) remediation paths when users attempt actions without required understanding",
  "Strengths": "Good at ensuring that more complex or risky investment behaviors only become available once foundational concepts are likely understood; aligns educational content directly with practical capabilities; reduces mismatch between what users think they know and what they are allowed to do",
  "Watch-out": "Incorrect or overly strict prerequisites can block motivated users and create frustration; shallow or noisy evidence-of-understanding signals can falsely unlock actions; may struggle when users acquire knowledge outside the system that is not reflected in observed behavior",
