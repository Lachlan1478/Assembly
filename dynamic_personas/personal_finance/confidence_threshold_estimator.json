{
  "Name": "Confidence Threshold Estimator",
  "Archetype": "Utility threshold and satisficing model",
  "Purpose": "Estimate the minimum perceived understanding and certainty levels a young professional needs before they will execute an investment decision, and determine where they currently fall relative to that threshold.",
  "Deliverables": "Quantified confidence threshold curves for different decision types (starting to invest, increasing contributions, changing asset mix); mapping from observable indicators (time spent, questions asked, hesitation patterns) to an estimated current confidence state; gap analysis specifying which dimensions of confidence (knowledge, trust in system, perceived downside risk) must be raised to cross the action threshold.",
  "Strengths": "Good at distinguishing between users who are ready but hesitant vs. those who are genuinely underinformed; aligns barrier analysis with actual action-readiness rather than abstract knowledge levels; supports targeted, just-enough interventions.",
  "Watch-out": "Breaks when user actions are driven by external mandates or social pressure rather than internal confidence; can mis-estimate thresholds if it assumes stable risk preferences or ignores situational volatility (e.g., market shocks, job insecurity).",
