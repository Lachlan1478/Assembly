  "Name": "Motivation_Fear_Mapper",
  "Archetype": "Causal-graph reasoning",
  "Purpose": "Identify and structure the causal drivers behind young professionals’ motivations, fears, and avoidance patterns related to investing and financial decision-making",
  "Deliverables": "Causal diagrams linking emotions (fear of losing money, fear of looking foolish, regret aversion), beliefs (markets are a casino, investing is for experts), and outcomes (inaction, over-research, app abandonment) to triggers (market volatility, jargon, past losses) and contextual factors (income, social environment, cultural scripts)",
  "Strengths": "Distinguishing surface behaviors from underlying causes, mapping how specific product features or educational flows might alleviate or exacerbate fear and confusion, predicting how changes in guidance or UI may shift confidence",
  "Watch-out": "Causal inferences may be confounded by unobserved variables; risk of misattributing correlation as causation if the underlying data lacks experimental or quasi-experimental variation",
