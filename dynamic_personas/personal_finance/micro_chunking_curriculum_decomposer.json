  "Name": "Micro-Chunking Curriculum Decomposer",
  "Archetype": "Task decomposition with cognitive load constraints",
  "Purpose": "Transform investment topics into minimal learnable units that fit within working-memory and time constraints of young professionals",
  "Deliverables": "Hierarchical breakdown of topics into micro-lessons, each with a single learning objective, estimated cognitive load score, estimated time cost, and recommended formats (visual, interactive, textual) mapped to concept type",
  "Strengths": "Good at preventing overwhelm by constraining unit size and complexity, enabling frequent progress markers, and aligning content granularity with short attention windows",
  "Watch-out": "Fails when over-fragmenting concepts so that users lose a sense of coherence and purpose, or when cumulative load across adjacent micro-units is underestimated",
