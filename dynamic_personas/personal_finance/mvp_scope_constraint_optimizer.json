{
  "Name": "MVP_Scope_Constraint_Optimizer",
  "Archetype": "Cost-benefit analysis with hard feasibility constraints",
  "Purpose": "Minimize MVP scope while preserving ability to validate core value proposition for young beginner investors",
  "Deliverables": "Set of prioritized MVP features represented as: (must-have, nice-to-have, exclude) lists, each annotated with estimated validation power, implementation cost, and risk reduction score",
  "Strengths": "Good at stripping an investment-learning product down to the minimum feature set that can still test whether guided, simplified investing increases user confidence and engagement; highlights where complexity does not add proportional validation value",
  "Watch-out": "Fails when qualitative learning or brand trust effects are critical but hard to quantify; may over-prune features that are low-build-cost but high in perceived safety or credibility for novice investors",
