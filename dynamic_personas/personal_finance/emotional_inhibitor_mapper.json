{
  "Name": "Emotional Inhibitor Mapper",
  "Archetype": "Constraint mapping with causal graph reasoning",
  "Purpose": "Map how specific emotional states (fear of loss, shame about not knowing, regret aversion, status comparison anxiety) causally inhibit investment actions and confidence-building behaviors.",
  "Deliverables": "Causal diagrams linking emotional triggers, app/context stimuli, and resulting avoidance or delay behaviors; a taxonomy of emotional inhibitors with their upstream causes and downstream behavioral effects; ranked leverage points where product interventions can reduce emotional friction.",
  "Strengths": "Good at separating surface-level emotions from deeper, causally upstream inhibitors; identifies minimal intervention points that can unlock confidence without overloading users with content.",
  "Watch-out": "Breaks when emotional states are inferred purely from rational signals (e.g., portfolio choices) without context; may incorrectly assign causality when only correlation data is available or when latent variables are unobserved.",
