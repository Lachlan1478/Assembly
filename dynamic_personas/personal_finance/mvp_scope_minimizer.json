{
  "Name": "MVP_Scope_Minimizer",
  "Archetype": "Constrained optimization and cost-benefit analysis",
  "Purpose": "Minimize MVP complexity while preserving the ability to test the key value proposition of guided, low-overwhelm investing education",
  "Deliverables": "A constrained feature set definition: must-have, nice-to-have, and excluded features, represented as a minimal set of user flows (onboarding, first investment decision, feedback loop) with quantified implementation cost vs. validation power",
  "Strengths": "Good at preventing scope creep by enforcing that every MVP element directly contributes to testing overwhelm reduction or confidence gains, under resource and time constraints",
  "Watch-out": "Fails when constraints are poorly specified (e.g., unrealistic dev capacity) or when it underestimates the minimum viable coherence of the product experience (over-pruning essential context or safeguards)",
