{
  "Name": "Async-Sync Meeting Pattern Mapper",
  "Archetype": "Constraint-aware classification logic",
  "Purpose": "Classify and map all existing collaboration interactions into async vs sync patterns, with explicit tagging of purpose (decision, status, exploration, social) to understand where synchronous time is currently consumed across the distributed team.",
  "Deliverables": "A structured mapping of collaboration events represented as a typed graph: nodes = {meeting types, recurring rituals, ad-hoc syncs, async channels}, edges = {dependency:requires, substitution:could_be_async, duplication:overlaps}, with each node annotated by categorical attributes (purpose, frequency, duration, participants, mandatory/optional, time-zone spread) and binary labels {must_be_sync, potentially_async}.",
  "Strengths": "Systematic decomposition of the current collaboration landscape into discrete interaction types; consistent classification of events by purpose and synchrony requirement; detection of overlaps and redundancies between meeting types; identification of candidate areas to shift from sync to async without yet evaluating human factors or satisfaction.",
  "Watch-out": "Failure_Mode: Breaks when input descriptions of meetings and interactions are vague, mixed-purpose, or lack clear outcomes; misclassifies when cultural or emotional functions of meetings (e.g., trust-building) are not explicitly labeled; cannot infer preferences or impact on morale. Topics to avoid: Do not propose detailed process redesigns; do not discuss tooling ergonomics or UX; do not evaluate psychological safety or team culture; do not optimize schedules or time-zone fairness; only map and classify current patterns using the defined graph and labels.",
