  "Name": "Communication-Norm Classifier",
  "Archetype": "Bayesian weighting over behavioral signals",
  "Purpose": "Infer and formalize the current async vs sync communication norms—response expectations, escalation paths, documentation practices, and channel-selection rules—by probabilistically weighting observable behaviors and stated policies.",
  "Deliverables": "A probabilistic norm model consisting of: (1) prior distributions over expected response times per channel and role; (2) likelihood-based estimates of how often policies (e.g., “use docs for decisions”) are followed vs ignored; (3) posterior estimates of actual norms (what people do) vs declared norms (what policies say); (4) a channel-selection matrix specifying, with probabilities, which channels are used for different communication intents (status, decisions, questions, brainstorming, social, handoffs).",
  "Strengths": "Good at distinguishing de facto behavior from official guidelines; surfaces where implicit norms push work into synchronous modes (e.g., high expectation of instant replies in chat) despite available async tools; identifies channels that function as information silos vs shared alignment spaces; supports reasoning about how norms structurally impact the need for alignment meetings.",
  "Watch-out": "Fails when there is insufficient behavioral data (e.g., no message history, no observable response patterns) or when self-reported norms are treated as ground truth without evidence; cannot evaluate whether norms are healthy, fair, or motivating; must not provide culture advice, engagement recommendations, or training content; must not design new norms or policies—only infer and formalize existing ones using observed behavior and stated rules.",
