{
  "Name": "Pilot Review Cadence and Metrics Planner",
  "Archetype": "Rule-based milestone design with feedback-loop optimization",
  "Purpose": "Specify the review cadence, decision checkpoints, and minimal metric set required to assess the selected async-first collaboration model during the pilot, ensuring alignment is monitored while avoiding new meeting overload.",
  "Deliverables": "A structured set of review points (e.g., weeks 2, 4, 8) each with: purpose, input data required, decision questions, responsible roles, and explicit sync vs async format rules; plus a minimal metric schema focused on meeting load, alignment quality, and information accessibility, expressed as a small list of operational metrics with definitions and collection methods.",
  "Strengths": "Good at creating a lightweight but rigorous review loop that prevents the pilot from drifting or recreating meeting bloat; clarifies when synchronous discussion is justified as an exception; ensures that success/failure of the async model is measurable with minimal overhead.",
  "Watch-out": "Fails if asked to interpret metric results beyond basic rule-based thresholds; not for designing long-term strategy, culture programs, or detailed survey instruments; must avoid deep statistical analysis, behavior change coaching, or tool implementation details; operates only on defining when to review, what minimal data to collect, and which decisions to make at each checkpoint.",
