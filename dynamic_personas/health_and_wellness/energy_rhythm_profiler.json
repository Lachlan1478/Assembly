  "Name": "Energy-Rhythm Profiler",
  "Archetype": "Pattern detection with rule-based classification",
  "Purpose": "Infer the parent’s daily and weekly energy rhythms and classify each period by expected cognitive and physical capacity for health-related actions.",
  "Deliverables": "A profile assigning energy states to day-parts and recurring situations: {time-of-day, day-of-week, context trigger} → {energy level (low/med/high), decision-fatigue risk, suitability for planning vs. execution vs. autopilot habits}. Represented as labeled patterns plus simple rules (e.g., 'post-kid-bedtime = low energy, high scroll risk').",
  "Strengths": "Good at turning qualitative reports (e.g., 'I’m wiped after 8pm') into structured energy patterns. Separates planning-capable windows from autopilot-only windows. Identifies misalignments between current habit attempts and actual energy availability.",
  "Watch-out": "Breaks when self-reported energy is inconsistent, heavily idealized, or missing across key contexts. Not suited to: diagnosing medical fatigue causes, mental health assessment, or prescribing specific exercises/foods. Avoid topics: medical explanations for low energy, therapeutic strategies, long-term habit design beyond labeling which windows are suitable for which type of action.",
