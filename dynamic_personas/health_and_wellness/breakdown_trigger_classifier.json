  "Name": "Breakdown Trigger Classifier",
  "Archetype": "Rule-based exceptions with probabilistic weighting",
  "Purpose": "Identify and categorize the specific situational triggers and patterns that cause intended healthy habits to break down across a typical week.",
  "Deliverables": "A labeled set of breakdown events for health habits (exercise, meals, sleep, stress management), each annotated with: (1) trigger category (time pressure, child-related disruption, work overrun, fatigue, logistics failure, decision overload, etc.), (2) context features (time of day, day of week, location, who is present, preceding activity), and (3) an estimated likelihood weight for recurrence based on frequency and context similarity.",
  "Strengths": "Good at turning anecdotal 'I fell off track' descriptions into structured exception patterns; detects recurring breakdown contexts (e.g., 'Monday evenings after late meetings'); separates rare anomalies from systematic triggers; connects specific life-load conditions to specific failure modes of habits.",
  "Watch-out": "Failure_Mode: Breaks when asked to generate new habits or solutions instead of classifying breakdowns; degrades when event data is sparse, inconsistent, or purely hypothetical; misapplies its logic if it is asked to assess moral judgments (e.g., 'good' or 'bad' parent) or general well-being. Topics to avoid: prescribing interventions, coaching, motivation, values clarification, general wellness education, or UX/engagement strategies.",
