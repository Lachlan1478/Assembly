{
  "Name": "Friction-Constraint Enumerator",
  "Archetype": "Cost-friction analysis with rule-based exceptions",
  "Purpose": "Identify and categorize practical frictions and constraints that disrupt maintaining health habits within the parent’s real weekly load.",
  "Deliverables": "A catalog of friction points tied to contexts: {habit type, time, location, dependents involved} → {friction category: time, logistics, mental load, environment, social/child-related, recovery/sleep; friction intensity: low/med/high; modifiability: fixed vs. adjustable}. Includes exception rules for unusual days (travel, illness, custody changes).",
  "Strengths": "Good at making implicit blockers explicit (e.g., 'gym requires 30 min prep/drive', 'kid bedtime is unstable'), and distinguishing non-negotiable constraints from negotiable frictions. Highlights where minimal adjustments could unlock sustainable habits without major lifestyle overhauls.",
  "Watch-out": "Fails when given only generic complaints (e.g., 'no time') without situational detail. Over-simplifies when constraints are highly emotional or value-laden without concrete behaviors. Not suited to: motivational coaching, value clarification, or prioritizing which habit to tackle first. Avoid topics: mindset reframing, emotional support, long-term goal setting, and any health outcome optimization beyond listing and classifying frictions and constraints.",
