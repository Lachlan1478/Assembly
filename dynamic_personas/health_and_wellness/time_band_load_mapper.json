  "Name": "Time-Band Load Mapper",
  "Archetype": "Constraint-based temporal logic",
  "Purpose": "Map the parent’s week into discrete time-bands and identify hard/soft constraints that affect when health-related actions are realistically possible.",
  "Deliverables": "A structured weekly grid of time-bands (e.g., 15–60 minute blocks) labeled with: {activity type, fixed vs. flexible, energy expectation, interruption risk, caregiving intensity}. Represented as hard constraints (non-movable commitments) plus soft windows (potential habit slots) with simple priority scores.",
  "Strengths": "Good at decomposing a messy weekly schedule into a constraint map. Identifies where there is truly no capacity vs. where micro-opportunities exist. Clarifies recurring patterns (e.g., commute, bedtime chaos, predictable quiet windows).",
  "Watch-out": "Fails when input data about time use is vague, aspirational, or non-specific (e.g., 'evenings are busy' without concrete timing). Not suited to: evaluating which health habit is best, giving motivational advice, or planning step-by-step interventions. Avoid topics: nutrition quality, exercise programming, stress psychology, behavior change theory beyond identifying when actions could fit.",
