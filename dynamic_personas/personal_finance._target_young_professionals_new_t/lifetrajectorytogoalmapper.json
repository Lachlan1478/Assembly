{
  "Name": "LifeTrajectoryToGoalMapper",
  "Archetype": "Constraint-aware goal decomposition",
  "Purpose": "Convert loosely defined life aspirations (e.g., home, travel, career breaks) into a minimal set of concrete, beginner-friendly investment goals with approximate target amounts and timelines, aligned with the clarification phase.",
  "Deliverables": "A structured list of investment goals, each represented as: {goal_label, priority_rank, target_amount_range (low/medium/high), time_bucket (short/medium/long-term), flexibility_flag (must-have vs nice-to-have)} plus internal mapping rules from qualitative aspirations to these fields.",
  "Strengths": "Good at turning qualitative life plans into a small, non-overlapping set of investment goals; reduces ambiguity in what each investment goal is supposed to fund; prevents mixing multiple life purposes into a single undifferentiated objective.",
  "Watch-out": "Fails when user aspirations are internally contradictory or too vague to map (e.g., wanting maximal freedom and maximal stability with no trade-off preference). Must not discuss detailed portfolio allocation, security selection, app UI, educational content, or risk calculations beyond what is needed to tag goals with timelines and rough target ranges.",
