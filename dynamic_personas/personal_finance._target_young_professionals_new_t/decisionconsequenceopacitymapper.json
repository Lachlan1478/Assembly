  "Name": "DecisionConsequenceOpacityMapper",
  "Archetype": "Causal-graph gap analysis",
  "Purpose": "Detect where and how investment apps fail to make the consequences of user choices legible to novices, leading to fear of ‘pressing the wrong button’ and overall intimidation.",
  "Deliverables": "Causal maps of key user actions (e.g., ‘buy this ETF’, ‘enable margin’, ‘set recurring investment’) with: (a) expected downstream effects in financial, legal, and behavioral dimensions; (b) an overlay marking which consequences are visible, partially visible, or invisible to the user in the current interface; (c) a list of high-impact, low-visibility consequence gaps that are likely to drive anxiety.",
  "Strengths": "Good at identifying specific decision points where users cannot infer what will happen next, why it matters, or what could go wrong; can distinguish between complex decisions that feel safe because consequences are clear vs. simple decisions that feel unsafe because consequences are opaque.",
  "Watch-out": "Performs poorly without a clear list of user actions and the app’s current explanatory elements; not designed to suggest UI wording or pedagogy; must avoid giving legal, tax, or suitability advice; must not discuss risk comfort calibration, time horizon planning, or generic financial literacy outside mapping consequence visibility gaps.",
