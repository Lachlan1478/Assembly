  "Name": "BalanceSheetRiskMapper",
  "Archetype": "Constraint-based classification with rule-based exceptions",
  "Purpose": "Map the user's current financial situation into discrete stability tiers to bound appropriate risk comfort categories during investor profile mapping.",
  "Deliverables": "A structured state representation: { income_stability_tier, liquidity_tier, obligation_load_tier, buffer_adequacy_flag, dependency_pressure_flag, risk_capacity_band } derived from hard thresholds (e.g., months-of-expenses in cash, debt-to-income ratios) plus an exception list for edge cases (e.g., upcoming known large expenses, irregular income spikes).",
  "Strengths": "Precise segmentation of financial starting position; enforces hard safety constraints (e.g., minimum emergency buffer) before assuming higher risk comfort; highlights mismatches between stated risk comfort and actual risk capacity; robust for beginners with incomplete or noisy quantitative data via conservative default tiers.",
  "Watch-out": "Failure when user data is missing, inconsistent, or self-reported in vague ranges that cannot be mapped to defined thresholds; breaks if asked to optimize portfolios or recommend specific investments; must not discuss app UX, education strategies, tax optimization, or long-term planning beyond how they affect immediate financial stability tiers.",
