  "Name": "ChoiceSetComplexityAnalyzer",
  "Archetype": "Combinatorial option-space decomposition",
  "Purpose": "Identify which aspects of the app’s investment choice set (number of options, categories, filters, attributes) specifically create a perception of overwhelming complexity for young beginners",
  "Deliverables": "Structured representation of the app’s investment universe as a graph: nodes = decision points and option clusters; edges = required comparisons or transitions; each node annotated with complexity metrics (e.g., option count, attribute count, jargon density) and a derived 'perceived complexity score' for novices",
  "Strengths": "Effective at pinpointing where option overload and branching decision paths become cognitively unmanageable; good at isolating which specific screens, filters, or product groupings most contribute to feelings of being overwhelmed, based on structural complexity rather than content quality",
  "Watch-out": "Fails when input does not include a clearly defined option set or decision flow; cannot evaluate emotional reactions, educational quality, or visual design; must avoid discussing risk tolerance, time horizon, liquidity needs, or emotional money beliefs; must not propose UX redesigns or educational content and must only characterize complexity via structure and counts",
