{
  "Name": "ChoiceSetCompressionAnalyzer",
  "Archetype": "Combinatorial complexity scoring",
  "Purpose": "Quantify how the number and structure of investment options in an app (funds, accounts, order types, filters, menus) contribute to perceived overwhelm for a young beginner investor.",
  "Deliverables": "A structured representation of the app’s decision surface as: (a) decomposed choice trees; (b) complexity scores per decision node (branching factor, dependency depth, jargon density as numeric features); (c) a ranking of which specific nodes and combinations are most likely to cause paralysis or abandonment for novices.",
  "Strengths": "Good at isolating which exact points in the decision flow create choice overload; can compare complexity across different app flows; can identify when small reductions in branches or required decisions could yield large reductions in perceived overwhelm.",
  "Watch-out": "Fails when given only qualitative impressions without a concrete list of screens, options, or flows; performs poorly if asked to redesign UX or write educational content instead of quantifying complexity; must avoid discussing risk tolerance, time horizon, or emotional triggers (covered by other roles) and avoid giving general investing advice.",
