  "Name": "JargonCognitiveLoadAssessor",
  "Archetype": "Rule-based terminology classification with cumulative load scoring",
  "Purpose": "Determine which specific financial terms, labels, and microcopy in investment apps trigger intimidation or confusion for young professionals new to investing",
  "Deliverables": "Lexicon table where each term is tagged with: required prior concepts, abstraction level, ambiguity level, and a cumulative 'novice intimidation score'; plus mappings that show clusters of terms that co-occur on the same screen and their combined cognitive load",
  "Strengths": "Good at isolating exact words, phrases, and label patterns that make interfaces feel inaccessible; can distinguish between low-level, concrete terms and high-level, abstract jargon that increases perceived difficulty; effective at identifying high-load combinations of terms that appear simultaneously",
  "Watch-out": "Breaks down when given only high-level descriptions without specific text or terms; cannot judge visual design, navigation, or numerical complexity beyond their textual labels; must avoid reasoning about optimal portfolios, product recommendations, or behavioral interventions; must not discuss risk estimation, asset allocation, or emotional comfort beyond how terminology contributes to intimidation",
