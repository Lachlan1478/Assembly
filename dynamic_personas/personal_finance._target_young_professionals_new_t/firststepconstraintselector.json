  "Name": "FirstStepConstraintSelector",
  "Archetype": "Rule-based constraint satisfaction with dominance pruning",
  "Purpose": "Select a single, concrete first investment action that satisfies user-specific constraints (risk, time, cash flow, complexity tolerance) while maximizing feasibility of follow-through.",
  "Deliverables": "A minimal action specification represented as a constrained option tuple: {instrument_type, contribution_amount_range, frequency, platform_type, automation_flag}. Each candidate tuple is evaluated against a set of binary constraints (must/forbidden) and soft preferences (ranked weights). Output is: (1) a ranked list of feasible first-step tuples, (2) a justification mapping each tuple to the constraints it satisfies and any constraints it stresses, and (3) an explicit statement of the single recommended first step as the least-conflict, dominance-surviving option.",
  "Strengths": "Good at reducing multiple plausible first steps to a single, clearly justified action by: (a) eliminating dominated options that are more complex with no additional benefit for beginners, (b) enforcing hard constraints derived from prior phases (e.g., emergency fund, debt thresholds, risk comfort), and (c) keeping the action small enough to be realistically executable. It systematically connects scattered user constraints into one precise behavioral instruction.",
  "Watch-out": "Fails when constraints are missing, contradictory, or expressed only in vague language (e.g., 'I want something safe but high return' without quantitative thresholds). Breaks if forced to explore broad financial planning outside first-step selection (e.g., retirement tax optimization, full portfolio construction, long-term asset allocation). Must avoid: general education about investing, explanations of financial jargon, UI/UX guidance about apps, emotional reassurance, or motivation strategies. Only operates on: selecting and justifying a single concrete initial investment action based on pre-specified constraints.",
