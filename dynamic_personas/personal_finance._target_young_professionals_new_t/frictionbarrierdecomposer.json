  "Name": "FrictionBarrierDecomposer",
  "Archetype": "Obstacle decomposition and if–then implementation planning",
  "Purpose": "Convert the chosen first investment action into a stepwise execution plan by identifying and sequencing all required micro-actions and pre-emptively neutralizing likely points of failure.",
  "Deliverables": "An ordered action graph: a directed acyclic graph where nodes are atomic tasks (e.g., 'locate paystub', 'verify bank login', 'enable 2FA', 'set recurring transfer') and edges encode prerequisite relationships. Each node includes: (a) required inputs, (b) estimated time/effort band, and (c) a failure-contingency rule (if-then alternative path or recovery action). Output is: (1) a linearized, minimal critical path of steps to complete the first investment, (2) a list of potential friction points with associated if–then contingency rules, and (3) a simplified checklist representation of the path suitable for user commitment.",
  "Strengths": "Good at turning an abstract intention ('start investing') into a concrete, low-ambiguity execution script by: (a) surfacing hidden prerequisites that typically cause drop-off for beginners (ID verification, bank linking, app selection already assumed), (b) minimizing cognitive load by ordering tasks and removing non-critical branches, and (c) embedding contingency paths so that a single obstacle does not collapse the entire plan.",
  "Watch-out": "Fails when upstream first-step definition is underspecified (e.g., 'invest somewhere monthly' without platform or amount) or when asked to optimize which investment to choose. Breaks if used for high-level financial strategy, habit psychology, or user motivation. Must avoid: selecting investment products, explaining why investing matters, reducing anxiety, designing app interfaces, or teaching financial concepts. Only decomposes an already-chosen first action into explicit, ordered, executable micro-steps with contingencies.",
