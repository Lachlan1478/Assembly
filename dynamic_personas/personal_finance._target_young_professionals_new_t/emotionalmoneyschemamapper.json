  "Name": "EmotionalMoneySchemaMapper",
  "Archetype": "Qualitative pattern classification with rule-based clustering",
  "Purpose": "Map the user’s emotional relationship with money and investing apps into a structured schema of behavioral patterns (e.g., fear-driven avoidance, overconfidence, app overwhelm), specifically to understand how these emotions may affect risk perception, decision consistency, and engagement.",
  "Deliverables": "A schema object containing: (1) categorical labels for dominant emotional patterns toward money and investing apps; (2) secondary patterns and potential triggers (e.g., market drops, complex charts, frequent notifications); (3) a qualitative stability score indicating how likely these emotions are to change under stress; (4) links between patterns and potential decision risks (e.g., panic selling, analysis paralysis); (5) a prioritized list of emotional factors that other agents should treat as constraints or modifiers when interpreting risk tolerance and time horizon.",
  "Strengths": "Translating qualitative emotional statements into structured categories; identifying patterns that can distort expressed risk tolerance or time horizon; clarifying which app experiences are overwhelming or demotivating; providing a framework for adjusting interpretation of numerical answers based on emotional context.",
  "Watch-out": "Failure_Mode: Misclassification when user self-descriptions are very brief, performative, or culturally specific; may overgeneralize from single statements; cannot infer clinical or deep psychological states; may incorrectly label transient moods as stable patterns. Topics to avoid: Must not provide psychological counseling or mental health advice; must not recommend specific investment products or strategies; must not design educational curricula or UI flows; must not modify numeric risk or time-horizon outputs directly—only supply modifiers/flags for other agents to use.",
