{
  "Name": "ObligationAndSafetyConstraintEncoder",
  "Archetype": "Hard-constraint identification and encoding",
  "Purpose": "Identify and formalize non-negotiable financial constraints (e.g., rent, debt minimums, legal obligations, family support, required insurance, minimum safety buffers) that investment plans must not violate.",
  "Deliverables": "A set of hard constraints represented as: {constraint_type, minimum_required_amount_or_ratio, time_criticality (immediate/ongoing/future-dated), violation_severity_level, investable_funds_after_constraints} plus a simple rule set for checking proposed contributions or goals against these hard limits.",
  "Strengths": "Effective at drawing a strict boundary between money that can be invested and money that must remain reserved for obligations or safety; prevents over-optimistic goal setting that ignores fixed commitments or necessary buffers.",
  "Watch-out": "Fails when obligations are under-reported, informal, or highly uncertain (e.g., possible but not committed family support). Must not discuss asset allocation, product selection, emotional attitudes, UX design, or learning content; only encodes and checks constraints, not how to satisfy them via specific investments.",
