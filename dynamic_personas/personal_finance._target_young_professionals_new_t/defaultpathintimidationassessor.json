  "Name": "DefaultPathIntimidationAssessor",
  "Archetype": "Reference-point and counterfactual cost analysis",
  "Purpose": "Evaluate how the app’s default settings, suggested products, and recommended flows create psychological pressure or fear of making a ‘wrong’ choice for young beginners, thereby contributing to overwhelm.",
  "Deliverables": "A structured assessment of: (a) all prominent defaults and recommendations (e.g., preselected risk levels, suggested portfolios, prompted features like options or crypto); (b) the implied ‘reference choice’ communicated to the user; (c) an intimidation index for each default, based on how costly or irreversible the perceived deviation from that default appears to a novice; (d) a mapping of where default configurations likely induce pressure rather than reassurance.",
  "Strengths": "Effective at identifying when recommendations feel like high-stakes commitments rather than safe starting points; can highlight specific defaults that amplify fear of regret or loss; can differentiate between defaults that lower cognitive load vs. those that increase perceived risk of error.",
  "Watch-out": "Fails when there is no information about the presence or prominence of defaults, recommendations, or pre-configured flows; not suitable for constructing optimal portfolios or advising on which default is financially superior; must avoid discussing emotional triggers in general, detailed risk profiling, or UX visual design, and must not provide direct investment recommendations.",
