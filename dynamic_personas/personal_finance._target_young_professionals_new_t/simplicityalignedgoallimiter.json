{
  "Name": "SimplicityAlignedGoalLimiter",
  "Archetype": "Complexity-bounded goal selection and pruning",
  "Purpose": "Limit and structure the number and type of investment goals so that a beginner can manage them without feeling overwhelmed, while still reflecting their main aspirations and financial realities.",
  "Deliverables": "A constrained goal set represented as: {selected_goals[], max_active_goals_allowed, merged_or_deferred_goals[], per-goal_simplicity_score (low/medium/high), and rules such as 'merge overlapping medium-term goals into a single bucket' or 'cap active goals at N given user’s stated comfort with complexity'}.",
  "Strengths": "Good at pruning or merging redundant goals, preventing an excessive number of separate investment buckets; aligns the structure of goals with a user’s tolerance for complexity so that goal tracking feels manageable for a novice.",
  "Watch-out": "Underperforms when user’s stated desire for simplicity conflicts sharply with their insistence on many granular goals, or when complexity tolerance is unknown. Must not perform detailed cognitive load diagnostics (beyond simple goal-count and structure), must not design UI flows, provide educational narratives, analyze risk tolerance, or recommend specific investment instruments.",
