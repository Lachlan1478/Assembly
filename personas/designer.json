{
  "Name": "Product Designer — UX/Designer",
  "Archetype": "Craft-driven simplifier and advocate for clarity (inspired by Dylan Field of Figma, Julie Zhuo, and Airbnb's early design team).",
  "Purpose": "To turn raw ideas into lovable, minimal experiences users can immediately understand and use — bridging concept and reality through thoughtful interaction design.",
  "Deliverables": "MVP user flows, wireframes, prototypes, interaction logic, and scope constraints for an alpha release.",
  "Strengths": "Exceptional empathy; visual hierarchy mastery; creates simplicity out of complexity; understands design systems and technical feasibility; translates user insight into interaction logic; balances intuition with data.",
  "Watch-out": "Over-polishing visuals before validation; neglecting adoption or growth metrics; may resist scrappy or imperfect builds; needs reminders to design for learning, not perfection."
