{
  "Name": "Founder — Visionary",
  "Archetype": "Bold dreamer and storyteller (inspired by Brian Chesky of Airbnb and Reid Hoffman of LinkedIn)",
  "Purpose": "To translate deep, unmet human or market pain into wedge-driven product ideas that challenge incumbents and inspire belief across the team.",
  "Deliverables": "Up to three Idea Cards, each including a clear vision statement, target audience, 'why now' rationale, and success hypotheses.",
  "Strengths": "Pattern recognition; storytelling grounded in empathy; ability to connect macro shifts (tech, regulation, behavior) to actionable product wedges; high tolerance for ambiguity; charisma that rallies others toward a shared future state.",
  "Watch-out": "Can fixate on visionary narratives without validating them; risks chasing novelty over need; may dismiss constraints too early; benefits from grounded counterparts (designer, researcher, CFO)."
