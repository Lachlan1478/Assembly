PHASE SUMMARIES
======================================================================

Phase: IDEATION
----------------------------------------------------------------------
During the ideation phase, five distinct startup ideas were generated,
each focused on enhancing the code review process for engineering
teams. The concepts, including CodeFlowSync, CodeCompass, CodeHarmony,
ReviewAI, and ReviewSphere, emphasize AI integration, collaboration,
and personalized insights to improve code review velocity while
minimizing context switching. Key decisions included ensuring that
each idea adheres to the defined constraints and user experience
principles outlined in the inspiration prompt.

Phase: RESEARCH
----------------------------------------------------------------------
In this meeting phase, several startup ideas were presented focusing
on enhancing the code review process through various innovative
approaches, including machine learning and automation. Ideas like
CodeContext, CodeFlow Sync, CodePulse, DevSync, and CodeStreamline
were discussed, each targeting engineering teams and aiming to reduce
context switching while improving code review velocity. The
overarching goal of validating market demand and identifying
whitespace in software development workflows was addressed, setting
the stage for further exploration of these concepts.

Phase: CRITIQUE
----------------------------------------------------------------------
During the critique phase of the meeting, various startup ideas
related to enhancing software development workflows and code review
processes were presented, including CodeFlowBridge, CodeBlend,
CodeFlowIntuit, CodeFlowNet, and CodeSync. Each idea was scrutinized
for its assumptions, potential risks, and alignment with user needs,
focusing on reducing context switching and improving code review
velocity. Key decisions involved identifying essential features and
constraints for the proposed concepts while recognizing the importance
of seamless integration with existing tools like GitHub/GitLab.

Phase: DECISION
----------------------------------------------------------------------
In this meeting phase, the team consolidated and finalized several
startup ideas focused on improving the code review process for
engineering teams. The outcomes include four distinct concepts:
"ReviewBot," "ReviewRadar," "CodeSync Optimize," and "CodeBalance,"
each addressing specific needs within software development workflows.
The final shared context provided a framework for defining ideas,
ensuring they are aligned with user needs and constraints while
emphasizing integration with existing tools.
