By leveraging AI-driven suggestions and inline comments, it enhances collaboration between developers by identifying relevant threads, context shifts, and required actions, all while seamlessly integrating into their existing workflows on platforms like GitHub or GitLab.",
      "target_users": "Engineering teams at startups and scale-ups (5-50 engineers), particularly those experiencing bottlenecks in code review or frequent context-switching due to heavy workload.",
      "primary_outcome": "The main value delivered is a more efficient code review process that reduces context switching, speeds up feedback loops, and maintains high-quality code standards. Teams will experience less disruption and enhanced focus, ultimately driving innovation and productivity.",
      "must_haves": [
        "AI-driven suggestions for inline comments based on code changes and team interactions.",
        "Contextual notifications that pull relevant conversations and documentation into the code review flow.",

        "The platform won't serve as a standalone dashboard for project tracking, focusing instead on enhancing real-time collaboration."
