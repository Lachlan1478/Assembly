Phase: IDEATION
----------------------------------------------------------------------
During the ideation phase, the team generated startup ideas focused on enhancing team communication and productivity for remote-first companies and distributed teams. Ideas such as SparkHub, SyncSpace, and SyncFree Teams were proposed, with a common goal of fostering connection and streamlining workflows in a remote work environment. The team emphasized the importance of developing innovative solutions to address the challenges of remote work while maintaining asynchronous collaboration across time zones.

Phase: DECISION
----------------------------------------------------------------------
In this decision phase, the team consolidated the feedback and decided on the final startup idea titled "FlowConnect," a virtual collaboration platform for remote-first companies and distributed teams. The JSON format for capturing startup ideas was finalized and provided a clear structure for documenting future concepts to align with the defined domain, target users, primary outcome, constraints, and UX rules.
