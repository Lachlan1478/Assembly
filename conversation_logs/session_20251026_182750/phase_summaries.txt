PHASE SUMMARIES
======================================================================

Phase: IDEATION
----------------------------------------------------------------------
During the ideation phase, the team generated a startup idea named
"CodeSync Pro" focused on real-time collaboration for streamlining
code reviews and enhancing team productivity for engineering teams at
startups and scale-ups. The key decision was to create a solution that
integrates with GitHub/GitLab, minimizes initial configuration, and
aligns with existing workflows to improve code review velocity without
sacrificing quality.

Phase: DECISION
----------------------------------------------------------------------
In this decision phase, the team discussed different perspectives on
generating startup ideas focusing on improving collaboration and
communication within engineering teams during software development.
Despite sharing various approaches and ideas, a final decision on the
startup concept in JSON format was not made. The shared context
includes the inspiration for the startup ideas and the criteria for
their generation, setting the stage for further ideation and
refinement in the next phase.
